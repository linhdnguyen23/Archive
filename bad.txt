Boston College jumped on the Wolfpack from the opening tip and hung on for a 91-87 win in the ACC tournament second round. Bubble Watch expects the loss still won't be enough to knock NC State out of the field of 68, but failing to even make the ACC quarterfinals could drop it to a double-digit seed.

The Wolfpack have been a great story this season, and the lift Kevin Keatts gave the program in Year 1 has already been dramatic. Still, this is a defense that benefited from opponents missing an unusually high percentage of their 3s in ACC play. If NC State does get in and makes a run in the field of 68, it will likely be a highly entertaining series of shootouts.


Florida State (20-11, 9-9 ACC)
(BPI: 39 | SOS: 44 | SOR: 39 | RPI: 50)

Florida State went 9-9 in the ACC, but that so-so mark is offset by the fact that FSU owns a win over North Carolina, as well as road victories at Florida and Virginia Tech.

The Seminoles missed a chance for a Quadrant 1 win against Louisville in the ACC quarterfinals, and thus, a chance to improve its seed.


Work to do


Louisville (20-13, 9-9 ACC)
(BPI: 31 | SOS: 28 | SOR: 42 | RPI: 38)

The Cardinals faced what everyone agreed was a "win-and-you're-in" situation against Virginia, so what happens when you lose 75-58? The simple answer is David Padgett's team could be in the tournament anyway, but it will be very close.

With a profile that includes a road win at Virginia Tech, road and neutral-floor victories over Florida State and a .500 record in ACC play, the Cards present a classic bubble look. Their fate now will depend on what happens with the rest of the bubble, but that "strategy" invariably means tense moments. There are always teams that clearly play their way in. Louisville just missed being such a team.
